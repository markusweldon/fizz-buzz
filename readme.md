# FizzBuzz ü•§üêù

The FizzBuzz algorithm is a programming exercise that involves iterating through a sequence of numbers and checking whether each number is divisible by 3, 5, or both. The algorithm prints out a specific string of characters depending on the divisibility of the number: "Fizz" for numbers divisible by 3, "Buzz" for numbers divisible by 5, and "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.

If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, the algorithm simply prints out the number. The FizzBuzz algorithm is often used as an programming exercise to assess a programmer's ability to write simple code using conditional statements and loops. Despite its simplicity, the FizzBuzz algorithm is widely recognized as a powerful tool for evaluating programming skills and can provide valuable insights into problem-solving abilities and coding proficiency.

The objective is broken down to:

1. Print the numbers from 1 to 100

2. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number

3. For multiples of 5, print "Buzz"

4. For a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
